Extensible Ethernet controller library for Arduino

This library provides an extensible Ethernet interface. It interfaces with Ethernet hardware, e.g. ENC28J60. It allows different protocols to be added via a plugin style system. Each protocol is provided as a class / library which processes the Ethernet buffer.


This library is licenced under the LGPL and is copyright (c) Brian Walton. It is derived from work by Pascal Stang and Guido Socher.
The source code is available at https://github.com/riban-bw/ribanEthernet.git.
